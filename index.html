# Bandwith Bytes for self hosting.

Here is a [calculator for your bytes](http://www.podtopia.net/bcalc.shtml) and [another one](https://radio.co/internet-radio-bandwidth-calculator).

If your podcast episode is 200mb and you produce every day then you will have a bandwith of
6.2 GB per listener per month! So that is the upload size as well.

We will round this up to 10GB per month.
Lets say you run this for one year, you will have 120 GB of data.
And lets say you have 10 daily listeners, that is 100GB of transfer.

-----
# S3

Now using the [s3 calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/createCalculator)

* 120 GB x 0.0230000000 USD = 2.76 USD per month


See this similar calculation [here](https://podnews.net/article/podcast-hosted-on-amazon-aws).
